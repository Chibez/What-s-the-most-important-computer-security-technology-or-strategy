Computer security basically is the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. It is the process of preventing and detecting unauthorized use of your computer system.

Importance of computer security

Before we get into how many types of computer security there are or what computer security and its types are, let’s go over the importance of computer security.

Types of security for computers and types of computer security threats

As I’ve said before, getting a security suite is an all-around problem solver for the different types of computer security threats. So make sure that when choosing individual types of security for computers that you’re possibly vulnerable, keep a more vigilant eye on network security and local security.


Antivirus

This type of security for computers being real-time means they use as little resources as they need, this does limit its capabilities though.

Anti-Spyware

Types of security for computers sort of muddle together in this case as antivirus and anti-spyware software do sort of overlap. Because of this, they typically both work as one program.

Firewalls

Firewalls are one of the most iconic and easily accessible types of security for computers, even being built-in with most Operating Systems now.
The basic gist of these types of security for computers is they monitor unusual network security activities and notify the user of these anomalies.

Anti-Malware

A pretty much last line of defense among the types of security for computers, anti-malware deals with similar things that anti-spyware and antivirus have to deal with but performs checks on a much “deeper” level than the other network securities and local securities.


Cyber Security Strategies

Strategy one: Protecting Critical Information Infrastructure

Critical information infrastructure is the backbone of a country’s national and economic security. It includes power plants, highways, bridges, chemical plants, networks, as well as the buildings where millions of people work every day. These can be secured with stringent collaboration plans and disciplined implementations.
Safeguarding critical infrastructure against developing cyber-threats needs a structured approach. It is required that the government aggressively collaborates with public and private sectors on a regular basis to prevent, respond to, and coordinate mitigation efforts against attempted disruptions and adverse impacts to the nation’s critical infrastructure.
It is in demand that the government works with business owners and operators to reinforce their services and groups by sharing cyber and other threat information.
A common platform should be shared with the users to submit comments and ideas, which can be worked together to build a tougher foundation for securing and protecting critical infrastructures.
The government of USA has passed an executive order "Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity" in 2013 that prioritizes the management of cybersecurity risk involved in the delivery of critical infrastructure services. This Framework provides a common classification and mechanism for organizations to:

•	Define their existing cybersecurity bearing

•	Define their objectives for cybersecurity

•	Categorize and prioritize chances for development within the framework of a constant process

•	Communicate with all the investors about cybersecurity.


Strategy two: Creating a Secure Cyber Ecosystem

This strategy explores the idea of having a strong and robust cyber-ecosystem where the cyber-devices can work with each other in the future to prevent cyber-attacks, reduce their effectiveness, or find solutions to recover from a cyber-attack.
Such a cyber-ecosystem would have the ability built into its cyber devices to permit secured ways of action to be organized within and among groups of devices. This cyber-ecosystem can be supervised by present monitoring techniques where software products are used to detect and report security weaknesses.
A strong cyber-ecosystem has three symbiotic structures − Automation, Interoperability, and Authentication.

•	Automation − It eases the implementation of advanced security measures, enhances the swiftness, and optimizes the decision-making processes.

•	Interoperability − It toughens the collaborative actions, improves awareness, and accelerates the learning procedure. There are three types of interoperability.

Semantic (i.e., shared lexicon based on common understanding)
Technical Policy − Important in assimilating different contributors into an inclusive cyber-defense structure.

•	Authentication − It improves the identification and verification technologies that work in order to provide −
Security

Affordability
Ease of use and administration
Scalability
Interoperability


Strategy three: Creating Mechanisms for IT Security

Some basic mechanisms that are in place for ensuring IT security are − link-oriented security measures, end-to-end security measures, association-oriented measures, and data encryption. These methods differ in their internal application features and also in the attributes of the security they provide. Let us discuss them in brief.

Link-Oriented Measures

It delivers security while transferring data between two nodes, irrespective of the eventual source and destination of the data.

End-to-End Measures

It is a medium for transporting Protocol Data Units (PDUs) in a protected manner from source to destination in such a way that disruption of any of their communication links does not violate security.

Association-Oriented Measures

Association-oriented measures are a modified set of end-to-end measures that protect every association individually.

Data Encryption

It defines some general features of conventional ciphers and the recently developed class of public-key ciphers. It encodes information in a way that only the authorized personnel can decrypt them.

Strategy four: Creating an Assurance Framework

The objective of this strategy is to design an outline in compliance with the global security standards through traditional products, processes, people, and technology.
To cater to the national security requirements, a national framework known as the Cybersecurity Assurance Framework was developed. It accommodates critical infrastructure organizations and the governments through "Enabling and Endorsing" actions.

Trusted Company Certification

Existing models such as SEI CMM levels are exclusively meant for software development processes and do not address security issues. Therefore, several efforts are made to create a model based on self-certification concept and on the lines of Software Capability Maturity Model (SW-CMM) of CMU, USA.
The structure that has been produced through such association between industry and government, comprises of the following:

•	standards

•	guidelines

•	practices

These parameters help the owners and operators of critical infrastructure to manage cybersecurity-related risks.

Strategy five: Encouraging Open Standards

Standards play a significant role in defining how we approach information security related issues across geographical regions and societies. Open standards are encouraged to:

•	Enhance the efficiency of key processes

•	Enable systems incorporations

•	Provide a medium for users to measure new products or services

•	Organize the approach to arrange new technologies or business models

•	Interpret complex environments

•	Endorse economic growth

Strategy six: Strengthening the Regulatory Framework

The objective of this strategy is to create a secure cyberspace ecosystem and strengthen the regulatory framework. 
Some highlights of this strategy are as follows:

•	Promotion of research and development in cybersecurity.

•	Developing human resource through education and training programs.

•	Encouraging all organizations, whether public or private, to designate a person to serve as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) who will be responsible for cybersecurity initiatives.

•	Effective implementation of public-private partnership is in pipeline that will go a long way in creating solutions to the ever-changing threat landscape.
